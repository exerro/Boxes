# Boxes

A puzzle/strategy game made with [love2d](https://love2d.org).

The aim of the game is to mark as many boxes as you can. By filling in the lines around a box, you mark it with either a '1' or '2', depending on which player you are.

The person to fill in the last line around a box marks the box, and gets another go to fill another line. The person in the end with the most boxes marked wins.
